This project is a fully interactive, AI-powered medical imaging analysis tool built using Gemini 2.0 (via Hugging Face) and LangChain. Users can upload medical images—such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or ultrasounds—and receive a detailed, structured diagnostic report generated by a medical-focused language model.
